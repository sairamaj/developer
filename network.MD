# Network Topologies
## Bus (old)
* Single long cable
* Terminators on either side of cable
* Devices connect using short patch cables
* No centralized hub or switches

## Star (common)
* Central connectivity to hub or switch
* Cable breaks do not affect the network
* Short patch cables are used for connectivity

 ## Ring
 * Physical Ring
  * Devices have two network connections
  * Dual counter-rotating rings
  * Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)
* Logical ring
  * Devices have one network connection
  * Physically wired as star
  * Token Ring

  ## Mesh
  * Multiple topologies linked together
  * Common in WAN environments
  * Topology adapters
  * Device topology connectors

  # Short Range Network Types
  * PAN (Personnel Area Network)
  * LAN (Local Area Network)
  * CAN (Campus Area Network)

  # Long Range Network Types
  * WAN (Wide Area Network)
  * MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
  * GAN (Global Area Network)

# Transmission Media Access
* IEEE 802.3: Ethernet
* IEEE 802.5: Token ring
* Wi-Fi

# Network Interface Card
* Unique 48-bit MAC address
* Required for network connectivity
* A single host can have multiple NICs

# Repeater
* Regenerating digital signals - repeater
* Regenerating analog signals - Amplifier
* Allows for long distances
* UTP cables have maximum distance of 100m

# Hub
* OSI model layer 1(Physical layer)
* Central wiring location for wired network devices
* All hub ports see traffic for all ports
* High possibility of pocket collisions
* Can function as repeater

# Network Bridge
* OSI model layer 2( Data link layer)
* Remembers which MAC addresses are plugged in to which bridge ports
* Transparent to higher-level protocols such as TCP/IP
* Wireless bridging
* Can function as repeater

# Network Switch
* OSI model layer 2(Data link layer)
* OSI model layer 3(Network layer) switches support routing
* Remember which MAC addresses are plugged into switch ports.
* MAC address table in memory
* VLANs

# Network Router
* Route network transmissions to other networks
* OSI model layer 3(Network layer)
* IP addresses
* Multiple network interfaces
* Routing table
