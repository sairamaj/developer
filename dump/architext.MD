* Software architecture
  * A software architect is a developer who is responsible for the high-level design and strategic planning of new software products. They are responsible for designing the overall structure of software applications, ensuring that the application is well-designed, technically sound, and aligned with the business and end-user requirements.
  * The software architect position is a newer post that has evolved after the introduction of multitier applications 1. The software architect is responsible for making fundamental structural choices that are costly to change once implemented . These choices include specific structural options from possibilities in the design of the software . Documenting software architecture facilitates communication between stakeholders, captures early decisions about the high-level design, and allows reuse of design components between projects.
