## What is Machine Learning?
* Find Patterns in data
* Uses those patterns to predict the future
  * Examples
       * Detecting credit card fraud
       * Determining whether a customer is likely to switch to a competitor
       * Deciding when to do preventive maintenance on a factory rebot

## R
* is an open source programming language and environment
    * Supports machine learning, statistical computing
    * Has many available packages
## Process
    * Ask the right question
    * Choose the right data
    * Iterate until you have a model that makes a good predictions
    * Deploy the model.

## Terminology
* Training Data
    * Prepared data used to create a model
* Supervisied Learning
    * The value you want to predict is in the training data ( that data is __labeled__)
* Unsupervisied Learning
    * The value you want to predict is not in the training dat ( that data is __unlabeled__)
