## Tips to learn new technology
* You tube videos
* Blogs
* Offical documentation
* Hands on through Quick tutorial if any
* Sometimes you may not understand in the begining but as you keep reading/listening the same material you will get slowly. Some times the same material through different media(blogs/videos) will give different perspective.
* If you find new jargons and don't understand them, then jump and quickly get overview of those jargons/acrynysm/technoligies.

## Tips to learn existing application
* Understanding the application as user.
* Get the code from appropriate and just browsing
* Correlate the Application interface if it is UI or Application functionality(if it is backend) to the Code.
* If appication is using any well known frameworks , jump to online and understand the framework. Example: React , Angular or any other framework.
* Initially it will be overwhelming by looking at the code but you don't have to understand entire code base at once. As you keep working on application understanding all connected application code is essential (at least integration layers)
