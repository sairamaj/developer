# Metrics

* Maintainability index
  * how hard is code to maintain
  * Higher is the better

* Cyclomatic Complexity
  * Structural complexity of code
  * Lower is better
  * How many paths are there through your code?
  * More paths -> harder to test
  * Harder to test -> harder to maintain

* Depth of inheritance
  * How deep is your inheritance hierarchy?

* Class coupling
  * Measure coupling vs Cohesion
  * Cohesion = good
  * Coupling = bad
  * Are there lots of dependencies that makes re-use difficult.

* Lines of code
   * Looks at IL
