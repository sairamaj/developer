* functions are first class values
* immutable data
* preference for recursion over looping
* algebraic type system.
* avoidance of side effects.
* object-oriented programming treats everything as __object__, functional programming treats everything as __value__
* functional programming is declarative(relationship ship between values what we want to compute, and machine figures it out) and oop is imperative (write sequence of instructions to tell the machine what to do)
* __Excel__ is functional programming. (you tell the relationship between cells and excel does the rest)
