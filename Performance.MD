## Scalability
* An application's ability to handle additional workloads
* without adversely affecting performance.
* by adding additional resources such as processor, memory, and storage capacity

## Web application performance characteristics
* Time to First Byte(TTFB)
* Total Pate response time ( aka time to Last byte, TTLB)
* Load test
  * User load
  * Request/sec
  * Errors/sec
* Resource Utilization
  * CPU
  * Memory
  * Disk/Network

## Kinds of Tests
* Performance Test
 * Determine or validate speed of application
* Load Test
 * Determines how an application's performance varies as load increases
* Stress Test
 * Determines application behavior when pushed beyond normal or peak load conditions
 * Smoke Test
  * An initial performance test used to see if the application can perform operations under normal load
 * Capacity Test
  * A load test variant used to determine a server's failure point, providing information on the total capacity of the current system architecture.
* Endurance Test
 * A kind of load test used to determine how an application performs over an extended time period with loads anticipated during production operations.

 ## Baseline
 * a __baseline__ is a set of performance data related to a given configuration of the application being tested
  * used for comparison
  * Full system or components
* __benchmarking__ is the process of comparing your system's performance against a baseline.

## Tools
* FireBug and YSlow
* Google chrome Speed Tracer
* IE9 Developer tools
* Visual studio
* Web Application Stress Tool (old)
* Application Center Test ( part of Visual studio)
* LoadRunner
* Visual studio

## Defining Requirements
* A specific request ( or series of requests)
* A specific response time threshold
* A specific load
* A specific set of application characteristics
* Specific resource constraints, if any
