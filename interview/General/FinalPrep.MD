* What are your strengths?
 * I never give up either it is professional or personnel.
   * One time there issue and needed socket level debugging and being application developer instead of giving it up, I learned enough socket programming and debugged a open software Stack Exchange Redis package and came up with some optimizations to solve the issue.
     * Details
		* Everything worked in during development as planned.
		* When we took this to our CERT region where we have lot of clients with lot of configuration data, things started failing with timeouts. We have to bring this time to reasonable value as this makes our application startup slower.
		* We could not use our Cert region for testing purpose.
		* We have to bring this big data to outside for testing and at the same time we cannot bring the same data outside the environment for security reasons.
		* I have to come up with different strategy with Azure, custom debugging of Stack Exchange implementation by learning Socket and Multiplexing and debug.
		* Found the issue that over head of ssl decryption of the many small pockets. At this time I wrote a optimized version of the collecting packets and doing ssl decryption on large packet.
  * I have mindset of nothing impossible either in professional or personnel within reasonable limits.
    * Professional
		* 
	* Personal
	  * Everest base camp example
	    * I had a miniscus tear in my right knee during a tennis game 5 years back and ever since I am not the same person I used to be.
		* When opportunity came to me from some of the friends who are making a trip to Everest base camp , I signed up and trained.
		* Inspite of good training , I did not feel good before my trip because falling sick 2 days before the trip.
		* I was determinied to go ahead anyway to see how far I can go.
		* Once I started the trip, I was able to continue by focusing and controlling my diet and made all the way including additional challenge which is making it to Kala Pathar.
	  * Tennis down 1-5 and came back win all the way.
		* I am a decent tennis player and play local tournaments. I had one time single tournament champion  one time.
		* While in this tournament, I was down 1-5 and close to get elimination and changed my strategy and kept telling myself that I can come back.
	    * I played with my new strategy which is balancing aggressive and defensive approach and came back finally to win that match.
  * I have great learning new skills and debugging skills
	* Given new application and new code base , I can quickly understand and troubleshoot application issues.
	* As I am debug expert in our devision, I get calls other groups to get on to to production issues of their product. 
	* Most of these I will not have any context ,but need to find out quickly about their application and their code base.
    * One time I was involved with one of the production issue 	where application is crashing very frequently and its initialization causing big performance issue for their end users.
	* I asked them to setup a capture memory dump and got their memory dump and their code base. I analyzed their process memory dump and found a dead lock issue.
	* Used the Windbg extension and extracted all the .NET assemblies from memory dump.
	* With JetBrain dotnet Peek .NET reflector tool  analyzed their code base. 
	* Found the issue and recommended the short term and long term options to fix.
	* Also I observed some leaks especially with WCF cleans up, which is causing some memory objects to hang for long time causing Garbage collection spikes.
	* Usually I need to understand the whole architecture , code base and give suggestions for any potential issues , but scenarios like production issues where we don't have time to get full picture, I can still go from problem spot and expand to the new areas for the applications and it issues quickly.

* What are your weakness?
  * Pronunciation
    * I have issue of pronouncing of some tough English words and this becomes issue now and then during my technical presentations. 
	* To overcome this I usually practice with on line tools  before hand.
    * On the same lines I have habit of talking fast during my presentations and working on this by practicing my speaking with recording and listening and taking feedbacks from my colleagues.
