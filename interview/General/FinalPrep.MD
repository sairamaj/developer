* What are your strengths?
 * I never give up either it is professional or personnel.
   * One time there issue and needed socket level debugging and being application developer instead of giving it up, I learned enough socket programming and debugged a open software Stack Exchange Redis package and came up with some optimizations to solve the issue.
     * Details
		* Everything worked in during development as planned.
		* When we took this to our CERT region where we have lot of clients with lot of configuration data, things started failing with timeouts. We have to bring this time to reasonable value as this makes our application startup slower.
		* We could not use our Cert region for testing purpose.
		* We have to bring this big data to outside for testing and at the same time we cannot bring the same data outside the environment for security reasons.
		* I have to come up with different strategy with Azure, custom debugging of Stack Exchange implementation by learning Socket and Multiplexing and debug.
		* Found the issue that over head of ssl decryption of the many small pockets. At this time wrote a optimized version of the collecting packets and doing ssl decryption on large packet.
  * I have mindset of nothing impossible either in professional or personnel within reasonable limits.
    * Personal
	  * Everest base camp example
	  * Tennis down 1-5 and came back win all the way.
  * I have great learning new skills and debugging skills
	* Given new application and new code base , I can quickly understand and troubleshoot application issues.
	* As I am debug expert in our devision, I get calls other groups to get on to to production issues of their product. 
	* Most of these I will not have any context ,but need to find out quickly about their application and their code base.
    * One time I was involved with one of the production issue 	where application is crashing very frequently and its initialization causing big performance issue for their end users.
	* I asked them to setup a capture memory dump and got their memory dump and their code base. I analyzed their process memory dump and found a unhandled exception causing the issue and as I was able to analyze the data ground it , gave the details to fix it. Also I observed some leaks especially with WCF cleans up which is causing some memory objects to hang for long time causing Garbge collection spikes.
	* Usually I need to understand the whole architecture , code base and give suggestions for any potential issues , but scenarios like production issues where we don't have time to get full picture, I can still go from problem spot and expand to the new areas for the applications and it issues quickly.

* What are your weakness?
  * Pronunciation
    * I have issue of pronouncing of some tough English words and this becomes issue now and then during my technical presentations. 
	* To overcome this I usually practice with on line tools  before hand.
    * On the same lines I have habit of talking fast during my presentations and working on this by practicing my speaking with recording and listening and taking feedbacks from my colleagues.
