* Rule of Sum
  * [info](https://brilliant.org/wiki/rule-of-sum/)
  * The rule of sum is a basic counting approach in combinatorics. A basic statement of the rule is that if there are nn choices for one action and mm choices for another action, and the two actions cannot be done at the same time, then there are n+mn+m ways to choose one of these actions.
  *  The rule of sum only applies to choices that are mutually exclusive, meaning that only one of the choices can be picked. To determine when to use the rule of sum (as opposed to the rule of product), try to rephrase the question. If the question can be rephrased with the word __"or,"__ this usually indicates that the rule of sum applies.

* Rule of Product
  * [info](https://brilliant.org/wiki/rule-of-product/)
  * The rule of product states that if there are __n__ ways of doing something, and __m__ ways of doing another thing after that, then there are __n×m__ ways to perform both of these actions. In other words, when choosing an option for n __and__ an option for m, there are n×m different ways to do both actions.

### Statistics
* Mean - average (total/count)
* Median - center (order and take middle, if more than )
* Mode - number shows most
* Standard deviation
  * Measure of spread (data vary from the average)
  * Low means close to average and high indicates data is spread out.
