* find the fastest growing term 
  * ex: an+b and __n__ is the fastest growing term
* take the coefficient term
  * ex: an+b. Here __a__ is the coefficient.
* examples
  * an+b  will become O(n)
  * an^2+bn+c will become O(n^2)
* Polynomial
  * O(n^c)  
    * O(n^2), O(n^3)
* Exponential
  * O(c^n)
    * O(2^n)
* Linear
  * O(n)
