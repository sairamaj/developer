* Arthimatic Progression
  * [info](https://byjus.com/maths/arithmetic-progression/)
  * General form : a a+d  a+2d  a+3d
  * nth term: an = a+ (n-1)*d
  * Sum of of n terms = S = (n/2) [ 2a+ (n-1) * d]
    * Sum of n natural numbers:
	  ```txt
	    (n * (n+1))/2
	  ```
* Geometric Progression
  *  [info](https://byjus.com/maths/geometric-progression/)
  * General form: a, ar, ar^2, ar^3
    * a - first term, r - common ratio
  * nTh term : ar^(n-1)
  * Sum
    ```txt
		S = a * [ (r^n -1]/(r-1)]  ( for 1...(n-1) terms)
	```
