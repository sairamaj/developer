* Selection Sort
  * Compare each element and sort
  * 2 loops
  * T:O(n*2) S:O(1)
  * Find position and move element
* Bubble sort 
  * Compare each adjecent elements
  * 2 loops
  * T:O(n*2) S:O(1)
  * Aalmost never used.
* Insertion Sort
  * Each out of order element is moved to appropriate place
  * 2 loops
  * T:O(n*2) S:O(1)
  * For small inputs, insertion sort almost always outperforms other sorts. Also when the number of inversions is small (the list is almost sorted), insertion sort is quite efficient, since there aren't many insertion operations required.
* Quick sort
  * Find element and move its position.
