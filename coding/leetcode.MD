### Array tips
* Check whether input array can be modified which can save space.

### C++
```C++
    // int to string
    auto s = std::to_string(10);

    // std string to char*
    char *s = s.c_str();

    // array initiliazation
    int array[3] = {1,2,3}; 
```

### Generic Tips
* When something is halved at every step, it has a O(log, n) time complexity.
* Two pointer approach
* Careful with ++ and -- with precedences and assignments
* Careful with expressions and use parenthesis for proper evaluation.
