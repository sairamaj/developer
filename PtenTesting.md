* Penetration testing (also called pen testing) is the practice of testing a computer system, network or Web application to find vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit.
* main objective is to determine security weaknesses.
* used to test an organization's security policy compliance, it's employees security awareness and the organization's ability to identity and response to security incidents.
* sometimes called __white hat__ attacks because in a pen test, the good guys are attempting to break in.

## Targeted testing
* Performed by organization's IT team and the penetration testing team working together.
* also called "lights-turned-on" approach (because everyone can see the test being carried out)

## External testing
* This type of pen test targets a company's externally visible servers or devices including DNS, e-mail servers, web servers or firewalls.
* Objective is to find out if an outside attacker can get in and how far they can get in  once they've gained access.

## Internal testing
* mimics an inside attack behind the firewall by an authorized users with standard access privileges.

## Blind testing
* simulates the actions and procedures of a real attacker by severely limiting the information given to the person or team that's performing the test beforehand

## Double blind testing
* In this type of pen test, only one or two people within the organization might be aware a test is being conducted.
* Useful for testing an organization's security monitoring and incident identification as well as its response procedures.
