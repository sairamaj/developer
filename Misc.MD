### [Rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)
In software engineering, rubber duck debugging or rubber ducking is a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.[1] Many other terms exist for this technique, often involving different inanimate objects.

dealing lot of things -> concurrency

doing lot of things -> parelllisim

dealign lot of thigns
    -> send email1
    -> send email2
    -> reply for the response for email1
    -> do some other tasks


doign lot of things at once
    -> sending email1,email2 and other things at the same time

### Semantic Version
Semantic version numbers have three numeric components, Major.Minor.Patch. When you fix a bug, you increment the patch (1.0.0 to 1.0.1). When you release a new backward-compatible feature, you increment the minor version and reset the patch version to 0 (1.4.17 to 1.5.0). When you make a backward-incompatible change, you increment the major version and reset the minor and patch versions to 0 (2.6.5 to 3.0.0).

* dynamic programming
  *	This problem has two important attributes that let us know it should be solved by dynamic programming. First, the question is asking for the maximum or minimum of something. Second, we have to make decisions that may depend on previously made decisions, which is very typical of a problem involving subsequences.
