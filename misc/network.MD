### Load Balancer vs GateWay

In general, a load balancer is used to distribute traffic between multiple servers, while an API gateway is used to provide a secure and consistent access layer for client applications 1.

Here are some scenarios where you might use one over the other:

* Use a load balancer when you need to:
  * Distribute traffic between multiple servers.
  * Ensure high availability of your application.
  * Scale your application horizontally.
  * Optimize resource utilization.
  * Improve performance and reduce latency.
  * Will work on Layer 4 & 7 of OSI (Transport & Application)

* Use an API gateway when you need to:
  * Provide a secure and consistent access layer for client applications.
  * Manage access to your backend services.
  * Authenticate and authorize incoming requests.
  * Enforce security policies.
  * Monitor and log incoming requests.
  * Will work on Layer 7 of OSI (Application)
  
In general, if you need to manage access to your backend services and enforce security policies, an API gateway is the better choice. If you need to distribute traffic between multiple servers and ensure high availability of your application, a load balancer is the better choice.
