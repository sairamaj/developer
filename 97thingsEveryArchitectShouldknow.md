A great software architect needs master both sides of the architect's coin: business and technology

1. Don't put your resume ahead of the requirements
   * Always put the customer's long-term needs ahead of your own short-erm needs and you won't go wrong
2. Simplify essential complexity; Diminish accidental complexity
   * Prefer frameworks derived from working code rather than ones cast down from ivory towers.
   * Look at the percentage of code you have in a solution that directly addresses the business problem versus code that   merely services the boundary between the application and the users.
   * Cast a wary eye on vendor-driven solutions Make sure that solution fits the problem.
3. Chances are , your biggest problem isn't technical
   * Increase your conversational effectiveness
     * Approach these events as conversations - not as confrontations.
     * Approach these conversations only after you've got your altitude right.
     * Use these as opportunities to set mutually agreed-upon goals.
