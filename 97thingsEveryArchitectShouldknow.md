A great software architect needs master both sides of the architect's coin: business and technology

1. Don't put your resume ahead of the requirements
   * Always put the customer's long-term needs ahead of your own short-erm needs and you won't go wrong
2. Simplify essential complexity; Diminish accidental complexity
   * Prefer frameworks derived from working code rather than ones cast down from ivory towers.
   * Look at the percentage of code you have in a solution that directly addresses the business problem versus code that   merely services the boundary between the application and the users.
   * Cast a wary eye on vendor-driven solutions Make sure that solution fits the problem.
3. Chances are , your biggest problem isn't technical
   * Increase your conversational effectiveness
     * Approach these events as conversations - not as confrontations.
     * Approach these conversations only after you've got your altitude right.
     * Use these as opportunities to set mutually agreed-upon goals.
4. Communication is King: Clarity and Leadership, its Humble Servants
   * Being clear and concise in the way you communicate your our ideas is vital to the success of any software project.
   * Keep things as simple as possible at the start of a project, and by all means do not start writing lengthy word documents.
   * Use tools like Visio to create simple diagrams to convey your thoughts.
   * Informal white board meetings (have a digital camera)
5. Application Architecture determines application performance
6. Seek the value in requested capabilities
   * architects focus on customer needs , helping the customers to answer the "why"
7. Stand Up!
   * If you're in any situation where you are talking to more than one person about your guidance, stand up.
8. Everything will ultimately fail.
  * Accept the failures will happen, you have the ability to design your system's reaction to specific failures.
9. You're negotiating more often than you think
10. Quantify
  * "Fast" is not a requirement.

11. One line of working code is 500 of Specification
  * Value the team members who work on implementing your vision. 
  * Listen to them. When they have problems with the design, there's a good chance they're right and the design is wrong
12. There is no one-size-fits-all solution
  * contextual sense â€“ a knowledge of what is reasonable within a given context.  
  * The most important knowledge of software patterns is the knowledge of when to apply them and when not to apply them, and the same is true of different root cause hypotheses and associated corrective actions during problem analysis
13. It's never too early to think about performance
14. Application architecture determines application performance
15. Commit-and-run is a crime.
