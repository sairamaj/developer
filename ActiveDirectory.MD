# LDAP
* Organized in a simple "tree" hierarchy with following levels
 * The root directory ( the starting place or the source of the tree) which branches out to
 * Countries, each of which branches out to
 * Organizations, which branches out to
 * Organizational units ( divisions, departments, and so forth) which branches out to 
 * Individuals (which includes people, files and shared resources such as printers)
* An LDAP directory can be distributed among many servers. Each server can have a replicated version of the total directory that is synchronized periodically. An LDAP server is called a Directory System Agent (DSA). An LDAP server that receives a request from a user takes responsibility for the request, passing it to other DSAs as necessary, but ensuring a single coordinated response for the user.

# Active Directory
* __Active Directory__ is Microsoft trademarked for directory service
* Centralized and standardized system that automates network management of uesr data, security and distributed resources and enables inter operation with other directories.
* Designed for distributed networking environments.
* Support for the __X.500__ standard for global directories
* Hierarchical organization that provides a single point of access for system administration ( management of user accounts, clients, servers and applications)
* An object-oriented storage organization, which allows for easier access to information
* Support for the __Lightweight Directory Access Protocol__(LDAP) to enable inter directory operability
